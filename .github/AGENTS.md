# AGENTS.md

## Scope

This file applies to `.github/` and its descendants.

## Project Context

- This repository is a Cherri Shortcuts toolkit for modular, maintainable Siri Shortcuts projects.
- Prefer Cherri-native solutions and Cherri documentation over ad hoc Shortcuts assumptions.
- Write in English (UK).

## Working Approach

- For non-trivial work, start with a short plan and then implement.
- Keep diffs small and reviewable.
- Avoid speculative Cherri syntax or actions; confirm behaviour in official docs first.
- When answering user questions about Cherri, cite the official docs page(s) used.

## Environment and Tooling

- The local environment bootstrap (`.codex/environments/environment.toml`) installs Cherri via Homebrew:
  - `brew tap electrikmilk/cherri`
  - `brew install electrikmilk/cherri/cherri`
- Use the repo's existing tooling and scripts if present; do not add production dependencies without approval.

## Cherri Docs First (Research Workflow)

- Prefer official Cherri docs on `https://www.cherrilang.org/`.
- Prefer Cherri CLI built-in docs for quick lookup when available:
  - `cherri --docs`
  - `cherri --docs=<category>`
  - `cherri --action=<action>`
- If docs are unclear or conflicting, note the uncertainty and cite the pages reviewed.

## Cherri-Specific Coding Guidance

### Compilation and Debugging

- Compile `.cherri` files with `cherri <file>.cherri`.
- Use `--debug` when troubleshooting compile/runtime issues.
- If building outside macOS, use `--hubsign` to sign with RoutineHub credentials.

### Variables, Constants, and State

- Use `@name` for mutable variables.
- Prefer `const` for values that do not change.
- Keep side effects predictable and avoid unnecessary mutable state.

### Includes, Functions, and Structure

- Use `#include` for modular code and package imports.
- Include function support before writing functions:
  - `#include 'actions/scripting'`
- Be aware Cherri function scaffolding injects supporting actions at the start of the shortcut; avoid relying on incidental order.
- Use includes to keep shortcuts modular rather than creating monolithic files.

### Comments and Output

- Cherri comments are omitted from compiled shortcuts by default.
- Use `--comments` only when you explicitly need comments preserved in the compiled output.

### Packages

- Use Cherri's package manager commands for shared code:
  - `cherri --init`
  - `cherri --install <package>`
  - `cherri --packages`
  - `cherri --package <name>`
  - `cherri --tidy`
- Review package trust prompts carefully before installing.
- Keep package includes explicit and committed so builds stay reproducible.

### Practical Best Practices

- Prefer `const` over mutable variables when values are fixed.
- Use `nothing()` placeholders when Cherri control-flow syntax requires an action block.
- Avoid large pre-built arrays when a loop or generated values is clearer and cheaper.

## Quality Gates (Default)

- Run the smallest relevant verification after changes:
  - Cherri compile for changed `.cherri` files
  - Existing tests/lint/typecheck/build scripts (if/when added)
- If no automated checks exist, state what was manually verified.

## OpenSpec Workflow (Repo Convention)

- For non-trivial feature work, use the OpenSpec prompts/skills in `.github/prompts/` and `openspec/`.
- Keep proposal, design, specs, and tasks aligned before implementation when using OpenSpec.

## Safety

- Ask before destructive changes (deletions, history rewrites, force pushes).
- Treat secrets as sensitive: do not hard-code keys or tokens.

## Directory-Specific Guidance

- Keep prompt files in `.github/prompts/` concise and task-oriented.
- Preserve prompt filenames and slash-command naming conventions unless the user requests a rename.
- When changing prompt text, prefer minimal edits that keep existing workflow intent intact.
